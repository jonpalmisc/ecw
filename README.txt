			    Efficient CMake Wrapper


1. What is this?

    I like the simplicity of 'make' but prefer the portability of CMake. This is
    my attempt at making CMake a bit more pleasant to use day-to-day.

    You probably shouldn't use this; this project is hacked together and I have
    no plans to support other use cases, etc.


2. Installation

    Use 'make install' if on macOS or Linux. Use ??? if on Windows.


3. Bugs?

    Almost certainly.
